Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         1,482 out of  15,360    9%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             2,761 out of  15,360   17%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,802 out of   7,680   23%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,802 out of   1,802 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,802   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       2,805 out of  15,360   18%
    Number used as logic:             2,133
    Number used as a route-thru:         44
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:     528
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:     100

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 35 out of     173   20%
    IOB Flip Flops:                      25
  Number of RAMB16s:                     17 out of      24   70%
  Number of MULT18X18s:                   3 out of      24   12%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     2 out of       8   25%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                4.10

Peak Memory Usage:  363 MB

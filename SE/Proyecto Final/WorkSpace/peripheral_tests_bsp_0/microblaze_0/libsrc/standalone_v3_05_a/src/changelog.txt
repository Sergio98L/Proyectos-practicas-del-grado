 * MODIFICATION HISTORY:
 *
 * Ver   Who  Date     Changes
 * ----- ---- -------- ---------------------------------------------------
 * 3.02a sdm  05/30/11 Added Xuint64 typedef and XUINT64_MSW/XUINT64_LSW macros
 * 3.02a sdm  06/27/11 Added INST_SYNC and DATA_SYNC macros for all the CPUs
 * 3.02a sdm  07/07/11 Updated ppc440 boot.S to set guarded bit for all but
 *                     cacheable regions
 *                     Update ppc440/xil_cache.c to use CACHEABLE_REGION_MASK
 *                     generated by the cpu driver, for enabling caches
 * 3.02a sdm  07/08/11 Updated microblaze cache flush APIs based on write-back/
 *                     write-thru caches
 * 3.03a sdm  08/20/11 Updated the tag/data RAM latency values for L2CC
 *		       Updated the MMU table to mark OCM in high address space
 *		       as inner cacheable and reserved space as Invalid
 * 3.03a sdm  08/20/11 Changes to support FreeRTOS
 *		       Updated the MMU table to mark upper half of the DDR as
 *		       non-cacheable
 *		       Setup supervisor and abort mode stacks
 *		       Do not initialize/enable L2CC in case of AMP
 *		       Initialize UART1 for 9600bps in case of AMP
 * 3.03a sdm  08/27/11 Setup abort and supervisor mode stacks and don't init SMC
 *		       in case of AMP
 * 3.03a sdm  09/14/11 Added code for performance monitor and L2CC event
 *		       counters
 * 3.03a sdm  11/08/11 Updated microblaze xil_cache.h file to include
 *		       xparameters.h file for CR630532 -  Xil_DCacheFlush()/
 *		       Xil_DCacheFlushRange() functions in standalone BSP v3_02a
 *		       for MicroBlaze will invalidate data in the cache instead
 *		       of flushing it for writeback caches
 * 3.04a sdm  11/21/11 Updated to initialize stdio device for 115200bps, for PS7
 * 3.04a sdm  01/02/12 Updated to clear cp15 regs with unknown reset values
 *		       Remove redundant dsb/dmb instructions in cache maintenance
 *		       APIs
 *		       Remove redundant dsb in mcr instruction
 * 3.04a sdm  01/13/12 Updated MMU table to mark DDR memory as Shareable
 * 3.05a sdm  02/02/12 Removed some of the defines as they are being generated through
 *                     driver tcl in xparameters.h. Update the gcc/translationtable.s
 *                     for the QSPI complete address range - DT644567
 *                     Removed profile directory for armcc compiler and changed
 *                     profiling setting to false in standalone_v2_1_0.tcl file
 *                     Deleting boot.S file after preprocessing for armcc compiler
 * 3.05a asa  03/11/12 Updated the function Xil_EnableMMU in file xil_mmu.c to
 *		       invalidate the caches before enabling back the MMU and
 *		       D cache.
 * 3.05a asa  04/15/12 Updated the function Xil_SetTlbAttributes in file
 *		       xil_mmu.c. Now we invalidate UTLB, Branch predictor
 *		       array, flush the D-cache before changing the attributes
 *		       in translation table. The user need not call Xil_DisableMMU
 *		       before calling Xil_SetTlbAttributes.

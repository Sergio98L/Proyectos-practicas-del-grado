Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    1
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         2,418 out of  15,360   15%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             3,987 out of  15,360   25%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          2,779 out of   7,680   36%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   2,779 out of   2,779 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   2,779   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       4,160 out of  15,360   27%
    Number used as logic:             3,165
    Number used as a route-thru:        173
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:     722
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:     100

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 61 out of     173   35%
    IOB Flip Flops:                      25
  Number of RAMB16s:                     18 out of      24   75%
  Number of MULT18X18s:                   3 out of      24   12%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     4 out of       8   50%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.84

Peak Memory Usage:  413 MB

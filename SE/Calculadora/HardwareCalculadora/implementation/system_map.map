Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         1,884 out of  15,360   12%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             3,062 out of  15,360   19%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          2,095 out of   7,680   27%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   2,095 out of   2,095 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   2,095   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       3,157 out of  15,360   20%
    Number used as logic:             2,560
    Number used as a route-thru:         95
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:     402
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:     100

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 54 out of     173   31%
    IOB Flip Flops:                      25
  Number of RAMB16s:                     18 out of      24   75%
  Number of MULT18X18s:                   3 out of      24   12%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     3 out of       8   37%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.85

Peak Memory Usage:  376 MB
